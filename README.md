# Default starter for Gridsome with Typescript (and nonde-sass)

This is the project you get when you run `gridsome create [project-name]` and then modify the default files to make it typescript compatible.

Before (or after) cloning this repo, be sure to install the Gridsome CLI tool so that the npm scripts will work properly.

## Install Gridsome CLI

`npm install --global @gridsome/cli`
